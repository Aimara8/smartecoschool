      "title": "Smart Homes",
      "description": "Smart homes are transforming the way we consume resources like light and water. Our IoT system combines advanced sensors, artificial intelligence, and an easy-to-use interface to ensure residents have full control over their energy consumption. Through the mobile app, users can schedule lights, monitor water usage in real-time, and receive personalized recommendations based on their consumption history. Additionally, smart sensors detect daily habits to automatically adjust the system. For example, if they detect the house is empty, they turn off the lights and adjust the thermostat, preventing waste. This not only contributes to economic savings but also minimizes environmental impact.",
